Acknowledgment
==============
The SoundSense program itself was written (and is maintained) by Petr Prokop. But a lot of 
talented people produced, recorded and edited the music and sound that went into this 
project. They deserve our acknowledgment and appreciation, too. If you enjoy SoundSense 
and are curious to see who these people are or how many different sources we used, then 
check out ATTRIBUTION.TXT in the Soundpack.zip package for a full credits list.
