gui/* - scripts with an ingame interface
========================================
Scripts that implement dialogs inserted into the main game window are put in this
directory.

.. note::

    In order to avoid user confusion, as a matter of policy all these tools
    display the word "DFHack" on the screen somewhere while active.

    When that is not appropriate because they merely add keybinding hints to
    existing DF screens, they deliberately use red instead of green for the key.
