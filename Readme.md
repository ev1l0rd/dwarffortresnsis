dwarffortressnsis
=================
A Dwarf Fortress installer made in NSIS.

How to compile
==============
First things first, clone the repository.

Get the [unicode NSIS compiler](http://portableapps.com/apps/development/nsis_portable) from PortableApps. Install it somewhere you can find it. Launch the app, and choose "Compile NSIS scripts". Next drag&drop dwarffortresss.nsi onto the MakeNSISW window. The file will be named DF.exe and will be in the same directory as it was compiled.

For most end-users, the files specified under Releases are those that you need. Compiling is rarely needed unless you want to modify the contents of the installer.
